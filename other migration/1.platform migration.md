**Platform migrations** are when you move your application and infrastructure from one hosting environment to another. Here are the common types:

**On-premise → Cloud**
- Moving from your own servers/data centers to AWS, Azure, or GCP
- Biggest shift companies make - reduces hardware management but requires cloud expertise

**Cloud → Cloud**
- Switching providers (AWS → Azure, etc.)
- Usually driven by cost, features, or vendor lock-in concerns

**Monolith → Microservices**
- Breaking a single application into smaller, independent services
- Often involves containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes)

**Serverless migration**
- Moving to functions-as-a-service (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions)
- No server management, pay per execution

**Hybrid/Multi-cloud**
- Spreading workloads across multiple platforms
- For redundancy, compliance, or avoiding vendor lock-in

**Key challenges:**
- **Downtime** - Keeping services running during the move
- **Data transfer** - Moving terabytes of data can take days
- **Compatibility** - Code might need refactoring for the new platform
- **Cost** - Migration itself is expensive, and new platform costs can surprise you
- **Training** - Team needs to learn new tools and processes

Most platform migrations happen in phases (not "big bang") to reduce risk. You might migrate one service at a time or run both platforms in parallel temporarily.
