Great question 👍
In that **monolith domain** diagram, **`profile`** is a **business concept**, not a tech feature.

Let’s explain **what “profile” actually means**, **what it should do**, and **what it should NOT do**—this matters a lot for domain migration.

---

## What is **Profile** (in business/domain terms)

> **Profile = a user’s personal and descriptive information**
> (who the user *is*, not how they log in or pay)

It answers questions like:

* Who is this user?
* How should they be displayed?
* How can we contact them?

---

## Typical responsibilities of **Profile**

### ✅ What belongs in Profile

**Personal data**

* full name
* display name
* date of birth
* gender (if required)

**Contact info**

* email (sometimes)
* phone number
* address

**Public / UI data**

* profile photo
* bio / description
* language preference
* timezone

**User preferences**

* notification preferences
* UI theme
* regional settings

---

## ❌ What does NOT belong in Profile

This is where many systems go wrong.

| Feature            | Why NOT profile      |
| ------------------ | -------------------- |
| Login / password   | Security domain      |
| JWT / sessions     | Identity/Auth domain |
| Billing info       | Financial domain     |
| Subscription plans | Commercial domain    |
| Roles/permissions  | Authorization domain |

Profile should be **boring data**, not critical logic.

---

## In your monolith example

```
User
 ├─ profile
 ├─ login
 ├─ billing
 ├─ subscriptions
```

This means:

* Everything is under **one big User concept**
* Different concerns are mixed
* Teams and rules get tangled

That’s why domain migration happens later.

---

## How Profile looks in a database (monolith)

```sql
user_profile
------------
user_id
full_name
avatar_url
phone
address
language
timezone
```

No passwords.
No payment IDs.
No auth tokens.

---

## How Profile behaves in code (Spring Boot example)

```java
class UserProfile {
  Long userId;
  String fullName;
  String avatarUrl;
  String phone;
  String timezone;
}
```

Typical operations:

* update profile
* view profile
* change avatar
* update preferences

---

## Profile during **Domain Migration**

When you migrate domains, **Profile is usually the FIRST thing to separate** because:

✔ Low risk
✔ Mostly CRUD
✔ Few cross-dependencies
✔ Easy to move to a new service

---

## After domain migration (clean model)

Instead of:

```
User
 ├─ profile
 ├─ login
 ├─ billing
```

You get:

```
Identity Domain
 └─ login, auth

Profile Domain
 └─ personal data

Billing Domain
 └─ payments

Subscription Domain
 └─ plans
```

Each domain:

* owns its data
* owns its rules
* can evolve independently

---

## Real-world example (common)

### Before

* Changing email affects login, billing, notifications
* Everything breaks easily

### After

* Profile owns email as *contact*
* Identity owns email as *credential*
* Billing doesn’t care

This separation avoids chaos.

---

## Interview-ready definition 🎯

> A profile represents a user’s personal and descriptive information such as name, contact details, and preferences. It is separate from authentication, billing, and authorization concerns, and is often the first domain extracted during domain migration.

---

## Mental model 🧠

> **Profile = who the user is**
> **Login = how the user proves identity**
> **Billing = how the user pays**
> **Subscription = what the user is entitled to**

If you want, next I can:

* design a **Profile microservice**
* show **Profile vs Identity DB schema**
* explain **email duplication problem & solution**
* show **how profile migrates safely from monolith**

Just tell me 👍
