Good catch 👍
Your question in simple words:

> **“For baseline, do I need old migration code / old SQL?”**

### ✅ Short, clear answer

**NO. Baseline does NOT need old migration code.**

That’s the whole point of baseline.

---

## Why baseline exists (again, very simply)

Baseline is used when:

* Your **database already exists**
* Tables were created earlier (manual / JPA ddl-auto / old scripts)
* You **do NOT have** (or do not trust) old migration SQL files
* You want to **start Flyway from now onward**

So Flyway says:

> “Okay, whatever is already in the DB — I’ll accept it as the starting point.”

---

## What you need for baseline

### ✅ You need

* Existing database (tables already there)
* Correct current schema in DB
* Decide a **baseline version number** (usually 1)

### ❌ You do NOT need

* Old Flyway SQL files
* Old `V1__init.sql`
* Old migration history
* Old Git commits of DB scripts

---

## What actually happens (step-by-step)

### Your DB already has

```
accounts
transactions
users
```

### You enable baseline

```yml
spring:
  flyway:
    baseline-on-migrate: true
    baseline-version: 1
```

### First app start

Flyway does:

1. Sees **no flyway_schema_history**
2. Creates `flyway_schema_history`
3. Inserts:

   ```
   version = 1
   description = << Flyway Baseline >>
   ```
4. ❌ Does NOT run any old SQL
5. ✅ App starts

That’s it.

---

## After baseline — how you work

From now on, you create **ONLY NEW migrations**.

Example:

```
V2__add_interest_rate.sql
V3__add_indexes.sql
```

Flyway will:

* Ignore anything before version 2
* Apply only **new changes**

---

## Very important warning ⚠️

Baseline means:

> “I trust the current DB schema.”

So **before baselining**:

* Make sure DB is correct
* Matches your JPA entities
* No missing columns

Baseline will NOT fix schema problems.

---

## Typical real project flow (common in companies)

1. Old project used `ddl-auto=update`
2. Production DB already live
3. Team wants Flyway
4. They **DO NOT recreate old migrations**
5. They baseline current DB
6. From that day → Flyway only

This is **normal and professional**.

---

## Interview-ready answer 🎯

> No, Flyway baseline does not require old migration code. It marks the existing database schema as a starting point so that only new migrations are tracked and applied going forward.

---

## One-line memory trick 🧠

> **Baseline = “I don’t care how DB was created — just start tracking from now.”**

If you want, next I can explain:

* baseline version choosing strategy
* baselining mistakes that break prod
* migrating from baseline to full history (advanced)
* real example with JPA entities + baseline

Just tell me 👍
