Good question 👍
**“seed”** is a very common word in DB migration, but people rarely explain it properly.

---

## What “seed” means (simple English)

> **Seed = inserting initial / default data into the database.**

Not schema.
Not tables.
**Just data.**

---

## Why “seed” data is needed

Some data **must exist** for the app to work.

Examples:

* default admin user
* system configuration
* initial roles (`ADMIN`, `USER`)
* demo account
* country list
* currency list

You don’t want to insert these **manually** every time.

---

## Seed vs Schema (important difference)

| Type                 | Purpose               |
| -------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Schema migration** | create / alter tables |
| **Seed migration**   | insert initial data   |

That’s why projects often have files like:

```
001-init.yaml   ← schema
002-seed.yaml   ← data
```

---

## Example from your project

### `002-seed.yaml`

```yaml
databaseChangeLog:
  - changeSet:
      id: 003-seed-demo-account
      author: saddam
      changes:
        - insert:
            tableName: accounts
            columns:
              - column: { name: account_no, value: "ACC-1001" }
              - column: { name: owner_name, value: "Demo User" }
              - column: { name: balance, valueNumeric: 5000.00 }
```

This means:

> “After tables are created, insert a demo account.”

That inserted row is called **seed data**.

## Characteristics of seed data

✔ Inserted **once**
✔ Tracked by Liquibase
✔ Same across environments (unless controlled)
✔ Versioned and auditable

---

## Types of seed data (real-world)

### 1️⃣ Mandatory seed (production)

* roles
* permissions
* system config

Example:

```
ROLE_ADMIN
ROLE_USER
```

### 2️⃣ Reference seed

* countries
* currencies
* time zones

### 3️⃣ Demo / test seed (dev only)

* demo users
* fake accounts

---

## Important production rule ⚠️

> **Never mix demo seed with production seed.**

### How teams handle this

#### Option A: Profiles

```yml
spring.profiles.active=dev
```

```yaml
# db.changelog-master.yaml
- include:
    file: db/changelog/002-seed-dev.yaml
    context: dev
```

Liquibase runs seed only in `dev`.

---

#### Option B: Preconditions

```yaml
- changeSet:
    id: seed-demo
    author: saddam
    preConditions:
      - onFail: MARK_RAN
      - not:
          tableExists:
            tableName: prod_marker
```

---

## Why seed data is done via Liquibase (not code)

❌ Don’t do this:

```java
@PostConstruct
insertDefaultData();
```

Why?

* runs every startup
* race conditions
* no history
* not idempotent

Liquibase seed:
✔ runs once
✔ tracked
✔ safe

---

## Interview-ready answer 🎯

> Seed data refers to initial or default records inserted into the database through migrations so the application can function correctly without manual data setup.

---

## One-line memory trick 🧠

> **Schema builds the house, seed puts furniture inside.**

---

If you want next:

* dev vs prod seed strategy
* idempotent seed patterns
* updating seed data safely
* deleting seed data (rollback cases)

Just tell me 👍
