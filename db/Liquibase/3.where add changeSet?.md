Great question — this is **the exact practical step** people miss 👍
Let’s answer it **very concretely**.

---

## Short answer (lock this in 🧠)

> **You add a new changeSet in a NEW changelog file, and then include that file in the master changelog.**

You **never** edit old changeSets.

---

## Standard Liquibase structure (Spring Boot)

```
src/main/resources/db/changelog/
├─ db.changelog-master.yaml   👈 ENTRY POINT
├─ 001-init.yaml
├─ 002-seed.yaml
├─ 003-add-interest-rate.yaml 👈 NEW changeSet goes here
```

Spring Boot loads **only**:

```
db.changelog-master.yaml
```

Everything else must be **included** from there.

---

## Step-by-step: where EXACTLY to add a changeSet

### 1️⃣ Create a NEW file (recommended way)

Example: you want to add a new column.

**Create a new file**

```
db/changelog/003-add-interest-rate.yaml
```

Put your changeSet **inside this file** 👇

```yaml
databaseChangeLog:
  - changeSet:
      id: 003-add-interest-rate
      author: saddam
      changes:
        - addColumn:
            tableName: accounts
            columns:
              - column:
                  name: interest_rate
                  type: DECIMAL(5,2)
                  defaultValueNumeric: 0.00
```

---

### 2️⃣ Include the new file in `db.changelog-master.yaml`

Open:

```
db/changelog/db.changelog-master.yaml
```

Add a new `include` line at the bottom 👇

```yaml
databaseChangeLog:
  - include:
      file: db/changelog/001-init.yaml

  - include:
      file: db/changelog/002-seed.yaml

  - include:
      file: db/changelog/003-add-interest-rate.yaml   # 👈 NEW
```

That’s it.

---

## What happens on next app start

```
App starts
↓
Liquibase loads db.changelog-master.yaml
↓
Sees new included file
↓
Checks DATABASECHANGELOG table
↓
Finds changeSet NOT executed
↓
Runs it
↓
Records success
↓
App starts
```

---

## ❌ What NOT to do (very important)

### ❌ Do NOT add changeSet to old files

```yaml
# ❌ WRONG
# editing 001-init.yaml
```

### ❌ Do NOT delete old changeSets

### ❌ Do NOT rename changeSet id

### ❌ Do NOT change author/id of applied changeSets

---

## Alternative (allowed but less clean)

You *can* add another changeSet at the **bottom of the same file**:

```yaml
# 002-seed.yaml
databaseChangeLog:
  - changeSet: { ... }

  - changeSet:   # 👈 new one
      id: 004-something-new
      author: saddam
      changes: ...
```

✅ Works
❌ Harder to maintain
❌ Messy in large teams

👉 **Best practice: one change = one file**

---

## Naming best practice (important)

| Item         | Rule                         |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| File         | `003-add-interest-rate.yaml` |
| changeSet id | unique, never reused         |
| author       | your name / team name        |
| Order        | controlled by include order  |

Liquibase execution order = **order of includes**, not filename sorting.

---

## Quick checklist 🧠

When you need a new DB change:

✔ Create new changelog file
✔ Add changeSet inside it
✔ Include file in master changelog
✔ Commit to Git
✔ Deploy

---

## Interview-ready answer 🎯

> In Liquibase, new changeSets are added in new changelog files under `db/changelog`, and those files are included in the master changelog. Previously applied changeSets are never modified.
