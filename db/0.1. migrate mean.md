Good question 👍 — because **“migration”** is an overloaded word in Spring Boot.

Here, **migration means *DATABASE SCHEMA MIGRATION***.

---

## What “migration” means (in this project)

**Migration = controlled change of database structure over time**

Not:

* ❌ moving a project from Spring to Spring Boot
* ❌ upgrading Java version
* ❌ copying data from one DB to another

It **specifically means**:

* creating tables
* altering columns
* adding indexes / constraints
* seeding required data
  …and doing it **safely, version by version**

---

## Think of it like this 🧠

```
Code version 1  →  DB version 1
Code version 2  →  DB version 2
Code version 3  →  DB version 3
```

**Flyway** is the tool that keeps **code version and DB version in sync**.

---

## Concrete example from our project

### Migration file

```
V1__init_schema.sql
```

### Meaning

> “This is database version 1.
> Create all required tables.”

```sql
CREATE TABLE accounts (...);
CREATE TABLE txns (...);
```

Flyway runs this **once** and records it.

---

### Next change (example)

You later add interest rate support 👇

```
V3__add_interest_rate.sql
```

```sql
ALTER TABLE accounts
ADD COLUMN interest_rate DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 0.00;
```

That is also a **migration**.

---

## Where Flyway remembers migrations

Flyway creates a table automatically:

```
flyway_schema_history
```

It stores:

* version (`1`, `2`, `3`)
* script name
* checksum
* executed time
* success/failure

So Flyway knows:

> “This DB is already at version 2 — don’t rerun old scripts.”

---

## Why migration is REQUIRED in real systems

Imagine:

* Dev adds a column
* QA adds an index
* Prod forgets to update DB

💥 system breaks.

Migration ensures:
✔ same DB structure everywhere
✔ repeatable builds
✔ rollback strategy
✔ audit trail (banking requirement)

## Migration vs Hibernate `ddl-auto`

| Feature        | Flyway Migration | `ddl-auto`  |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| Versioned      | ✅ Yes            | ❌ No        |
| Safe for prod  | ✅ Yes            | ❌ No        |
| Rollback       | ⚠️ Manual        | ❌ No        |
| Auditable      | ✅ Yes            | ❌ No        |
| Enterprise use | ✅ Mandatory      | ❌ Forbidden |

👉 **In production, `ddl-auto` is usually DISABLED.**

---

## One-line definition (interview ready)

> **Migration is the process of evolving a database schema in a controlled, versioned, and repeatable way using tools like Flyway or Liquibase.**

---

If you want, next I can explain:

* **why V1/V2 naming is critical**
* **what happens if migration fails in prod**
* **how teams handle rollback**
* **migration strategy in microservices**

Just say which one 👌
